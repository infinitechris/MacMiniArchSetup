I grew tired of having to randomly follow different guides (and possibly have to re-work my install): to setup Arch my normal way, so instead I figured I'd create this somewhat useful guide.

I'm not going into full detail of the steps performed, as they're listed on the guides referenced.

After this guide is complete, Arch with KDE Plasma for a DE will be setup!

This guide assumes you're installing from a USB Key.

**NOTE**: Following this guide WILL overwrite all MicroSD and Hard Drive contents.

Moving on.
